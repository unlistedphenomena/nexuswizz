              Withdrawal functionality will be enabled in the upcoming Shanghai
              upgrade planned for Q1/Q2 2023 (as with any upgrade, timing
              subject to change). This enables previously staked ETH to be
              deposited into execution layer accounts, closing the loop on
              staking liquidity, and taking one more step on Ethereum’s journey
              towards building a sustainable, scalable, secure decentralized
              ecosystem.

              Shanghai marks the end of an undefined lock-up period for ETH

              For the Shanghai upgrade to take effect, a simultaneous upgrade to
              the Beacon Chain must take place named Capella. Node operating
              stakers should stay tuned to client communication channels to be
              alerted of upcoming client updates planned for Q1/Q2 2023.

              Stakers who need to update their validator withdrawal keys can
              broadcast this message once the Capella upgrade has taken place.
